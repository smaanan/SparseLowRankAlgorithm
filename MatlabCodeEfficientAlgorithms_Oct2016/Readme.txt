  	number =	"2",
  	pages =		"251--273",
  }
  
  The Matlab functions arfit_mod.m and arord_mod.m have been produced by 
  modifying the corresponding functions from the package ARFIT:

  author={A. Neumaier and T. Schneider},
  journal={ACM Trans. Math. Softw.},
  title={Estimation of parameters and eigenmodes of multivariate autoregressive models},
  year={2001},
  volume={27},
  pages={27-57},
  }
  
  Other functions from this package are also used in our implementation.
