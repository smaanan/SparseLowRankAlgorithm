Data: FinData.mat (pre-processed as described in [Abdelwahab et al, 2008])

Main function for running the experiment: run_exp_SelectSP_NS_ME.m
The results are saved in Results_FinData.mat

Function comp_sim_index.m computes the similarity index between the estimates
from Results_FinData.mat and the graph from [Abdelwahab et al, 2008]

For producing Fig. 5, function run_exp_SelectSP_NS_ME_Vals_Masks.m should 
be used. 
The results are saved in Results_FinData_Vals_Masks_crit.m, where crit is the ITC applied.
Then the graphs are generated by using read_vals
